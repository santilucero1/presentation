            <h1>Santiago Lucero</h1>
            <p>I am 24 years old, I studied telecommunications engineering for 4 years, 
                I started programming for fun in things that interested me.
                and in 2023 I decided to change my career to what I really like.
              I am currently studying IT at the National University of Rio Cuarto, Argentina.
